This is my introduction to SpringBoot, I learned how to send a data for inyection,
I learned what is DTO, I saw a small API Rest example, I did a model with some
information, I worked with @ModelAttribute, @RequestParam, HttpServetRequest, @PathVariable,
API Rest send a json as POST request, @Value, Encoding, SpringExpressionLanguage(SpEL),
Map SpEL with @Value, Enviroment for read settings, difference between redirect and foward as 
an anwser to MethodController, and deploy from terminal. Finally, I decided to deploy in an instance
of Oracle Cloud. I used Postman for check my request to my API
